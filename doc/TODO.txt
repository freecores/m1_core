Simply RISC M1 Core ("Mistral") TODO List
=========================================

Implementation
--------------
At the moment the CPU has no interrupt handling.


ISA Functional Verification
---------------------------
Several simulations have been performed by Simone Lunardo and Paolo Piscopo;
the verification status for each instruction is as follows:

- LOAD/STORE
Only 32-bit LW/SW have been tested and they work.
Other sizes are not working.
Unaligned accesses are not implemented at all.

- ALU I-TYPE, ALU R-TYPE, SHIFT, MULTIPLY-DIVIDE
All tested and working.

- JUMP/BRANCH
Jump are working (J JAL JR JALR) including the delay slot.
Equality branches (BEQ BNE) execute 2 delay slots rather than just 1.
Disequality branches (BLEZ BGTZ BLTZ BGEZ) do not work yet.
