Simply RISC M1 Core ("Mistral") TODO List
=========================================

Implementation
--------------
Memory hierarchy requires at least a Wishbone interface
and some sort of caches.


Functional Verification
-----------------------
The simulation work has been performed by Simone Lunardo and Paolo Piscopo;
the verification status for each SIMPLE instruction is as follows:

- LOAD/STORE
Common 32-bit LW/SW have been tested and they work.
Other sizes are not working.
Unaligned accesses are not implemented at all.

- ALU I-TYPE, ALU R-TYPE, SHIFT, MULTIPLY-DIVIDE
All tested and working.

- JUMP/BRANCH
Jump are working (J JAL JR JALR) including the delay slot.
Equality branches (BEQ BNE) execute 2 delay slots rather than just 1.
Disequality branches (BLEZ BGTZ BLTZ BGEZ) do not work.
